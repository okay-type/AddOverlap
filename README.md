2019 10 07 : Jackson added
- updated pen import to fontparts
- added a ui so users can set the offset value
	- FYI, the old default was 30
	- setting a value of 0 makes a double point
	- setting a negative value fills in the corner
	- more usefully, using a negative value on the extreme point of a curve will make a nice flat segment
